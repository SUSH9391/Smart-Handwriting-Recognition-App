# Important Library:

To install the required libraries for your Flask application, you can use pip, the Python package installer. Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands:

1. Install Flask:

    ```
    pip install flask
    ```

2. Install Flask-Bootstrap:

    ```
    pip install flask-bootstrap
    ```

3. Install Werkzeug:

    ```
    pip install Werkzeug
    ```

4. Install Pytesseract (if needed for OCR functionality):

    ```
    pip install pytesseract
    ```

Once you've installed these libraries, you should be able to run your Flask application and utilize its features.

1. Then Simply Type This in Terminal & Enjoy:

    ```
    python app.py
    ```

## Understanding Plagiarism
Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work, ideas, or expressions without proper acknowledgment. In the context of coding, plagiarism occurs when one copies code from another source without giving credit or proper attribution. This can include copying entire code blocks, snippets, or algorithms, as well as using ideas or concepts without acknowledgment.

### Why Plagiarism is Harmful
Plagiarism undermines the principles of academic and professional integrity. It devalues the original author's work and creativity, erodes trust within the community, and can have serious consequences for individuals and organizations. Additionally, plagiarized code may introduce security vulnerabilities, bugs, or legal issues if used without proper understanding or authorization.
